## Ground rules
- Respect opt-in and user control.
- Any new long-running behavior must include a visible stop/pause mechanism.
- Any new credit mechanism must be auditable and reproducible.

## Development
- `cargo build --manifest-path native/Cargo.toml --release`
- `cargo run --manifest-path server/gmf_relay/Cargo.toml`
